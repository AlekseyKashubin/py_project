Considered to be the birthplace of coffee, Ethiopia is drenched in the same history and complexity that is found in many of their coffees. This season, we will progressively release several Ethiopian coffees including Yukro, Reko, and Nano Challa.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Nano Challa Cooperative is located in Western Ethiopia in the Agaro Gera Woreda region, just a few kilometers up the road from Yukro in the Jimma Zone. Until the last decade, this area (including Nano Challa) mainly produced low-grade, dry-processed coffees. Jimma was known for amazing honey that tasted like jasmine, white tea, and citrus (sound familiar?). However, their coffee was being traded as a commodity. In 2010, Nano Challa was among the first cooperatives in the area to install a washing station and begin preparing washed coffee. With a little support and training, they began producing some of the finest washed coffees in the world.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>THE RESULTING NANO CHALLA IS A SOFT, GENTLE, FLORAL CUP OF COFFEE</h2><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Today, Nano Challa has built a reputation for exquisite quality. Upon visiting the cooperative we were stunned by the amount of detail they placed into producing clean coffee. The cooperative is made up of about 400 members who each harvest heirloom varieties that have been growing for generations in the forest surrounding the washing station. At the washing station, the coffee is pulped and washed using a Penagos, a machine that is commonly seen across Latin America, known for using minimal water to pulp and wash coffee. Following the wash, the coffee is then soaked overnight. It then goes through the drying process where the coffee is carefully moved throughout the day and dried very slowly. The members at Nano sort through the parchment thoroughly during the process, picking out the unwanted seeds, winnowing the chaff, and reserving only the parchment that is perfectly clean. The resulting Nano Challa is a soft, gentle, floral cup of coffee with flavor notes reminiscent of the area’s prized honey: jasmine, white tea, and citrus.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I’ll never forget the day I visited Nano Challa. Not only was I welcomed by a team of producers whose detailed work still inspires my day-to-day work, but I also tasted the most delicious honey. A couple of days after my visit, I tried Nano Challa. It tasted just like their honey with undertones of jasmine, white tea, and citrus. Nano Challa has been a reminder of how special it is to actually taste pure terroir in coffee and, in this case, honey as well. It is invigorating to taste these clean, genuine flavors and it reinforces our love and appreciation for all the hard work it takes to make it happen. Grab a bag of Nano Challa.</span></p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"Farmers working at the Nano Challa Washing Station in Ehiopia","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"A coffee Western Ethiopia in the Agaro Gera Woreda region","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"coffee, release, Ethiopia, Ethiopian coffee","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"Farmers working at the Nano Challa Washing Station in Ehiopia","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"259957","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"259957","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"5/26/2020 1:49:00 pm"}},{"addition_to_head":"","page_title":"How We Brew: Moccamaster + Precision Brewer Edition","page_header":"How We Brew: Moccamaster + Precision Brewer Edition","meta_description":"The Moccamaster is a coffee brewer made to consistently brew to Gold Cup standards.

Working in the food and beverage industry, there can be a tremendous amount of waste and we wanted to make a change for the part we would play in the industry. Because of this decision, almost every product that we use in our cafes is compostable—cups, sleeves, straws, and trash bags. For those items that cannot be composted, we opt to recycle, such as our milk jugs and coffee bags.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Even then, we are searching for compostable replacements that maintain the same level of quality as their non-compostable counterparts. For instance, we are currently engaged in a three-year-long research project to find compostable coffee bags that maintain the same level of freshness as our foil bags. This initial ethos of leaving the world better than we found it is alive in every action at Madcap and we will continue to find ways to improve the world we share.</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://sandbox.madcapcoffee.com/core/media/media.nl?id=266359&c=5223487_SB1&h=sBQYWpTofN7K92cplPIElIjmcQ7E-EVWYy0RX7Tgcpw_YzmG\" height=\"1080\" style=\"border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Alongside of our environmental efforts, we strive for sustainable relationships.

The land is an hour east of Pitalito city, where we’ve been buying coffee since 2015. Over the past six years, Jose has transitioned over 80% of his farm to the Pink Bourbon (or Borbón Rosado) variety. Pink Bourbon has only been discovered in the past decade and remains relatively rare and mostly isolated to a handful of producers in Huila. Unlike most coffee that ripens to a deep red color, Pink Bourbon ripen to a pink color. It’s referred to as a hybridization of Yellow and Orange Bourbon (Bourbon that ripens to yellow or orange respectively), though the tree and flavor tend to have traits akin to Ethiopian varieties.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261340&c=5223487&h=Lxdr4gol1aA_Oi6-IFce42oBjdjzdAuCaHW45j1etZjcB4Qo\" alt=\"Borbon rosado coffee cherries on tree\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p>Jose Libardo began planting Pink Bourbon a few years back. When the discovery of the variety was unveiled, buyers were willing to pay a higher premium based on the superb cup quality yielding loads of florals, deep sweetness, and nice complexity. After planting in small sections, he realized the variety was actually growing healthier and was more resistant than his other coffee (including Castillo, the Colombian created variety with resistance and production in mind). Due to the great fortune with Pink Bourbon, Jose transferred four of his five hectares to Pink Bourbon.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261341&c=5223487&h=fBebpxsYN2uzrnQ0oQUsU3i84Lr_LrJfrHf1MmmTQTs5lHgQ&652654\" alt=\"Jose Libardo planting Pink Bourbon\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p>After harvesting the Pink Bourbon, Jose Libardo has a unique style of processing, with the goal of expressing as much flavor from the variety as possible. Once the coffee has been harvested, the cherry is sealed in large GrainPro bags, removing as much oxygen as possible to creating an “anaerobic-like” fermentation, while the cherry is still intact, for 24-48. Following the time in cherry, the coffee is then pulped and fermented in sealed bags without oxygen for 36-48 hours, and then washed and dried on covered raised beds. The Pink Bourbon variety offers a bright floral flavor, while the oxygen-free fermentation creates a punchier, fruit-forward flavor in the cup. The result is a bright, floral, juicy cup of coffee with notes of raspberry lemonade, lavender, and milk chocolate.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261342&c=5223487&h=t2JUHLt_UEkcyosm-qb8_E7b72vlkdIpK_Wey0ZTofcwkioY\" alt=\"Jose Libardo walking on his farm\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"Borbon rosado coffee cherries","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"The pink bourbon variety offers a bright floral flavor, while the oxygen-free fermentation creates a fruit-forward flavor.","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"Borbon rosado coffee cherries","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"261338","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"261338","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"4/20/2020 11:45:00 am"}},{"addition_to_head":"","page_title":"How We Brew: Chemex Edition","page_header":"How We Brew: Chemex Edition","meta_description":"The Madcap Chemex recipe to brew your favorite coffee at a home.","meta_keywords":"","customrecorddata":"8","name":"How We Brew: Chemex Edition","urlPath":"blog/how-we-host-chemex-edition","url":"how-we-host-chemex-edition","template":"default","type":1,"pageTypeName":"ext-blog-post","customrecordscriptid":"CUSTOMRECORD_SC_BLOG_PAGE_TYPE_POST","cmscreatable":true,"fields":{"custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_author":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_excerpt":"We’ve always been fond of the simplicity of the brewer paired with the thick, bleached filters that assist in delivering a clear, nuanced transparency in the cup.","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_content":"<p>We’re back with the next installment of our <a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/blog/category/brewing\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>at-home brew guides</u></a>:the Chemex.

Yes, it is our 5th coffee from Colombia this season! It’s a coffee unlike any of the others it shares its nationality with. It has been 3 years since we first began exploring coffees from Inza, a tiny valley in Cauca only a couple hours northwest of our San Sebastian coffee. Though there is close proximity, Inza and La Plata are very different areas; from the terrain, to the people, and the history. The coffee does a great job of expressing these differences as well. After tasting coffees from Inza for the first time a few years ago, we’ve kept this area on our radar. This past year we spent a good chunk of time exploring some relationships and we are looking forward to building upon them in the years to come.</p><p><br></p><p>Aside from the pristine beauty of the winding mountainscape, the high elevations, and the cool temperatures found in the valley, history is imperative to the coffee produced here. The first coffee variety to be produced widely all over Colombia was Typica. In the 70s, much of Colombia’s coffee production started transitioning over to Caturra, a coffee with higher production than Typica. Following Caturra, the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC) began working on a new variety simply called “Colombia” with the goal of producing higher yields than Caturra and greater resistance to weather and diseases. In the 2000s, we saw the launch of Castillo (essentially, the “new Colombia”) that was produced to give higher yields and be even more resistant to coffee disease than the Colombia variety.</p><p><br></p><h2>WHAT I LOVE ABOUT INZA IS THAT THE COFFEE OFFERS A TASTE OF THEIR UNIQUE CULTURE.</h2><p><br></p><p>Today, the majority of coffee grown in Colombia is the Castillo variety. There is still a decent amount of Caturra, however, it is shrinking. Typica is even more rare to come by, except in Inza. During the spread of the Colombia variety and particularly during the spread of Castillo, Inza was very difficult to travel to. The roads were in rough shape and, later on, there was a lot of FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) activity in the area. This resulted in the FNC canvassing the entire country with new varieties while Inza remained predominantly planted with Typica, Caturra, and even some Bourbon as it was in the past.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261354&c=5223487&h=jJlaMGhHSW4q64gpd7TBfyI4g_7eDYYY41RyzBbMInE7VIel\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\" height=\"435\" class=\"ql-embed-selected\" alt=\"INZA, COLOMBIA coffee\"></p><p>When I taste these coffees, they generally offer a brightness and a floral tea quality that is special to find in Colombia. The floral characters are met with syrupy sweetness. Depending on the vintage or the lot, we may see more dark berries versus juicy orange, however, the syrupy sweetness is always alive. As I’ve spent more time in the area, it seems that there is more than just the absence of new varieties that make Inza special. Here, you find a community that has evolved and shaped uniquely and beautifully unlike any other coffee producing area in the country. When you visit and spend time with the people in Inza, a story starts to emerge that gives great scope and richness to the place. What I love about Inza is that the coffee offers a taste of their unique culture as well as a glimpse of what coffee in Colombia may have been like 50 years ago.</p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"INZA, COLOMBIA","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"A tiny valley in Cauca","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"INZA, COLOMBIA","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"261353","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"261353","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"3/16/2017 2:36:00 pm"}},{"addition_to_head":"","page_title":"Yenni Reinoso: Limited Selection from The Reinoso Family","page_header":"Yenni Reinoso: Limited Selection from The Reinoso Family","meta_description":"The Reinosos’ coffee hails from plants that surround their home in the outskirts of Herrera, Tolima, a part unknown to most.","meta_keywords":"","customrecorddata":"11","name":"Yenni Reinoso: Limited Selection from The Reinoso Family","urlPath":"blog/yenni-reinoso-limited-selection-from-the-reinoso-family","url":"yenni-reinoso-limited-selection-from-the-reinoso-family","template":"default","type":1,"pageTypeName":"ext-blog-post","customrecordscriptid":"CUSTOMRECORD_SC_BLOG_PAGE_TYPE_POST","cmscreatable":true,"fields":{"custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_author":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_excerpt":"The Reinosos’ coffee hails from plants that surround their home in the outskirts of Herrera, Tolima, a part unknown to most.","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_content":"<p>I first learned of Luis Reinoso in December of 2010. While most folks were holiday shopping for their loved ones, I was shopping for our first coffee from Colombia. We filled tables with coffee from single producers across the country in hopes of discovering something special. In the process, what we found was more than just special; we found an extraordinary selection from the Reinoso family that soared above the rest. The team at Madcap and I were immediately in love. Since, Luis’ coffee has become an instant fan favorite at Madcap.</p><p><br></p><p>The Reinosos’ coffee hails from plants that surround their home in the outskirts of Herrera, Tolima, a part unknown to most. The farm is tucked away in a secluded, lush micro-terroir that exists in its own remote valley. There are no other people or homes in sight when you reach the Reinoso household – only coffee, happy trees, and the peaceful sound of a roaring river at the foot of the farm.&nbsp;The farm receives ample rainfall, and just enough sun during midday as it peaks over the eastern hills, before falling behind the western peaks just a few hours later. The river provides the farm with plenty of water, a cool breeze, and delicious fish for pescado frito.&nbsp;This isn’t a place that someone stumbles upon. It’s a full day’s journey from any major city, and still a 3+ hour trip on rocky unpaved roads from the nearest small town of Herrera. The trek requires a 4×4, a skilled driver, and an immunity to car sickness (which fortunately, I have been self-diagnosed with).</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261357&c=5223487&h=_Ui-cTOLHmGOzkPbyW9ZL-qZ-JQnz4UxFidBpGc_tO75CAOG\" alt=\"Luis and Yenni Reinoso with a Madcap Camp Cup\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p>From my handful of visits with Luis, what I’ve noticed most is his diligence. He stays humble while he dedicates himself to doing honest work in the details. We’ve spoken often of the meticulous processing he does to achieve proper fermentation and the careful work he spends on his land keeping the trees healthy. We’ve mentioned his detailed work quite often over the years at Madcap and, on my most recent visit, there was something he wanted to make very clear: the farm and the land are a family effort, and his wife, Yenni, is equally responsible for the coffee.</p><p><br></p><h2>YENNI AND LUIS’ COFFEE IS A LABOR OF LOVE.</h2><p><br></p><p>Yenni is shy, and a little bashful. She blushes at Luis’ words while simultaneously affirming the truth, “yes, this coffee is a family effort.” She supports the team when it comes to harvesting only ripe coffee. They strive to harvest as much as possible themselves and receive support from extended family as it’s difficult to train labor in the area to harvest to their standard. While Luis ferments and washes the coffee right outside their bedroom window, Yenni is in charge of the drying process that finishes on the roof of their home. She rakes the coffee regularly and sorts out unwanted parchment and assures even, slow drying is taking place (a process that has progressed greatly since we began our partnership 8 years ago).</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261358&c=5223487&h=N_8rKiySUBV58fqKGcDQrKPG3rrClT4g2xAhIQjXkXoAMpvs\" alt=\"The Reinoso's coffee farm\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p>Aside from the coffee, she does the work that keeps the farm, household, and family churning. In tandem with managing the drying beds, she anchors the home while Luis is working the fields. Whether it’s taking care of their three young children or preparing nourishing meals from fresh ingredients around the farm, there are a lot of day-to-day tasks on the farm to keep things moving smoothly. After years of sharing “Luis Reinoso” coffee, it has become apparent that it’s more than simply variety, terroir, and precision in the details that make this coffee great. Yenni and Luis’ coffee is a labor of love.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the year, we taste through many separations of coffee within the Reinoso farm. With each separation we taste, we share our feedback as they constantly look for more information and always want to keep improving. We consistently experience lovely tasting coffee, and at times we see extraordinary coffee that leaves us grasping for the right words. For the lots that leave us speechless, we pay premiums on-top of premiums to honor and celebrate the Reinosos’ excellent work. Beginning today, we will be rolling out a new coffee from the Reinoso Family: Yenni Reinoso. This is a limited selection from their farm, leaving us speechless as we get an even clearer, brighter window into the excellence of Yenni and Luis’ process.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261359&c=5223487&h=o2B0jjH23Dmw2RpxdN8Z0FiDNWnGtE0NJatYdIHxAFRjvI-0\" alt=\"Farming at the Reinoso coffee farm\" height=\"991\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3120\"></p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"The Reinoso coffee farm","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"An all-time Madcap favorite","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"Coffee","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"261356","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"261358","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"10/11/2018 2:50:00 pm"}},{"addition_to_head":"","page_title":"The Rodriguez Family Selections","page_header":"The Rodriguez Family Selections","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","customrecorddata":"12","name":"The Rodriguez Family Selections","urlPath":"blog/the-rodriguez-family-selections","url":"the-rodriguez-family-selections","template":"default","type":1,"pageTypeName":"ext-blog-post","customrecordscriptid":"CUSTOMRECORD_SC_BLOG_PAGE_TYPE_POST","cmscreatable":true,"fields":{"custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_author":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_excerpt":"The story of Madcap began with the first coffee we ever purchased, El Porvenir.","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_content":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);\">When we opened in 2008, we were committed to seeking out relationships with coffee producers whose work inspired us, so we purchased Gloria Rodriguez’s Cup of Excellence winning coffee.

This year we’ve had the opportunity to release a few cult favorites alongside a couple of new separations from the Rodriguez Family Farms. All of the coffee from the Rodriguez Family is limited, while a few are exceptionally limited, only available on the menu for a couple weeks.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>El Porvenir</h2><p>El Porvenir, which translates to “The Future” or “Things to Come”, fittingly was the first coffee we selected to share at Madcap when we opened. Though the elevation at El Porvenir sits lower than most of our line-up, the area fosters a special terroir, benefiting from cool nights and constant wind, while growing some of our favorite varieties: Bourbon and Typica. Intention and care are woven throughout every step with the most diligent picking we’ve seen anywhere, delivering an absolutely lovely expression of the coffee from this area. Drinking El Porvenir is familiar, comforting, and feels like hanging out with an old friend. This years vintage tastes like chocolate brownies, subtle citrus, and caramel. We have twenty five bags of this coffee available and expect to have it on the menu for approximately two months.</p><p><br></p><h2>INTENTION AND CARE ARE WOVEN THROUGHOUT EVERY STEP, WITH THE MOST DILIGENT PICKING WE’VE SEEN ANYWHERE</h2><p><br></p><h2>ELEFANTE VIEJO</h2><p>Mysterious coffee trees were discovered on the Rodriguez Family farms about a decade ago. The origin was unknown, but these naturally mutating trees had some resemblances of their neighboring trees, Bourbon and Typica. Although the fruit it produced was twice as dense, much larger, and contained up to five times more juice than it’s neighboring varieties, the Rodríguezes’ decided to harvest a small separation and see what it tasted like. The result was one of the juiciest and most interesting coffees they had encountered. Somehow, I convinced them to sell me all of the micro-lot that first year.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261363&c=5223487&h=96TfimnXPb5QLdQRaitPEV4GbGxOjUroXlyi3iAakAgZDWLt\" alt=\"Basket full of coffee cherries\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p>The Elefante Viejo is a separation of these few original trees that still exist on their farms and grow at 1400 meters. This coffee is laced with lavender floral, deep dark fruit juiciness, and cocoa, with spice complexity on the finish. Elefante Viejo is a rare opportunity to enjoy coffee from the old vines that brought us this new and exciting flavor over the years.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>ELEFANTE NUEVO</h2><p>When the Rodriguez Family discovered Elefante in those mysterious trees, they concurred with a few friends about the potential of this coffee variety and began collecting seeds from those trees, planting a new plot of Elefante at the highest peak of their farms at 1700 meters. Last year, this plot began producing it’s first fruits. The Elefante Nuevo is a separation of this first cultivation of “new vine” Elefante. The coffee presents itself youthfully, in contrast with Viejo, holding superb acidity, white tea, dried flowers, and delicate, soft fruits throughout.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>PACAMARA, LA GLORIA</h2><p>Pacamara is a hybrid that came on the scene about half a century ago and, produced in El Salvador. The hybrid is a mix of Pacas and Maragopipe, producing seeds that are large with low density. Pacamara is known for its intense acidity and wild complexity. It’s important to note though that Pacamara from La Gloria is in a league of its own. We’ve been head over heels for this coffee for years, and each year, this is my favorite Pacamara I taste. This particular coffee is grown at 1550 meters on a plot named La Gloria (just up the road from El Porvenir), filled with bright lemon, fuzzy peach, pound cake, and lemon grass.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261364&c=5223487&h=fDR28suxpwyfraF4LtNVpBMakIwUVbcxGwUXkj0EQZ6lNidI\" height=\"430\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1500\"></p><p>With another exceptional lineup from the Rodriguez Family this season, each of these coffees sparkle with their own unique character and complexities.

However, they are a rising force that has always been dear to us at Madcap. We first tasted and purchased coffee from Burundi back in 2009. The coffee tasted like freshly picked blackberries and the texture was as viscous and sweet as Michigan maple syrup. It was unlike anything we’d experienced and we haven’t turned back, offering seasonal features every year since. Though it may not be the most popular opinion, when I’m being honest, there are few coffees that I enjoy drinking more than a well-produced coffee from Burundi.</p><p><br></p><p>The finest coffee from Burundi have a particular structure and rich, sugary depth that is rarely found in other parts of the world. This year, for the first time ever, we are jazzed that we get to share these three beautiful coffees from top notch producers at the same time.</p><h2><br></h2><h2><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ABOUT BURUNDI</strong></h2><p>Burundi is a small, landlocked country in East Africa, just south of Rwanda. For perspective, the entire country is about 1/10th the size of Michigan. The mountainous country is filled with high and diverse elevations, rolling hills, green landscapes, varied climates, and fertile land that is prime for coffee production. Specialty coffee only made a significant splash in Burundi in the past decade as the government began focusing more resources into it. Since, we’ve seen the export of specialty coffee sky-rocket during this time, making it the country’s number one export.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261371&c=5223487&h=lbxhQPQ-gks-Q-x97IzHJ-XOcHo2ZrPannfQOcXEjwwAVh6Y\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p>Although coffee from Burundi can be stunning, there are quite a few challenges that exist throughout the production chain to get the coffee to us. To start with, the country has seen internal conflict since the 1960s with ongoing civil unrest. Many farmers have had to flee their land simply for safety. The unrest can also create challenges with entering and exiting the country as well as difficulty with coffee transportation within the country. Burundi is the 2nd most densely populated country in Africa and nearly 75% of the population lives below the poverty-line. Although agriculture drives the economy, there is a lot of displacement across the country and many people find themselves with limited access to food.</p><p><br></p><p>Since Burundi is a landlocked country, once the coffee is produced, it has a very long distance to travel prior to shipping as it must pass through Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and lastly Kenya before catching a ride across the ocean to the United States. Once the coffee arrives and is roasted, Burundian coffee is also infamously known for Potato Taste Defect that can happen in about 5% of cups. However, with the work of our partners, we are seeing it occur in less than 1% of our Burundian coffees. Needless to say, these coffees have a long, and at times, challenging journey before arriving in our cups.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261372&c=5223487&h=LMZoDA5X4Ys0-ltXIrQT35AZ5cKsM1Ak7IRHKsqjaL0YuOWz\" alt=\"Coffee cherries drying at a coffee farm in Burundi\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><h2><br></h2><h2>OUR PARTNERS:</h2><p>For each of these 3 coffees we have partnered with our friends over at Long Miles Coffee Project. Long Miles is owned by Kristy and Ben Carlson who have been living and working with Burundian coffee for over a decade now. The family-owned business has two washing stations (Bukeye and Heza) that collect and process coffee from neighboring hills that they keep separate. At the heart of Long Miles Coffee Project is a family that is passionate about producing amazing tasting coffee and caring for the well-being of the coffee farmers they partner alongside.

At first glance, it looks like your typical Latin American coffee community. It’s a small, rural community that relies on agriculture to support the economy. These economical similarities can be found across many of the countries within the region. However, when you look closer and spend more time with the folks who live in Santa Barbara, there is a specific culture, support, trust, and dedication that creates a particular mass of energy. It is a place that is unlike anywhere else.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>At first, the difference in Santa Barbara is subtle, but the longer you are there, the more clearly their way of life comes into focus. The details of the land, the communication amongst the community, how the producers process their coffee, and the ethics that permeate every facet of their work cause this region to stand out. On a visit, with a little time and observation, it becomes clear that the flavor of these coffees match the stand-out nature of the region. Brighter acidity, thicker sugars, and most of all—complexity—showcases why Santa Barbara has become one of the most sought after regions in the world for Specialty Coffee.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261375&c=5223487&h=CPHqD7qys8DZnKA5AAwNrFo-9Rwd6JyJDbEl-vZ7WtN2v83A\" alt=\"A family sorting dried coffee\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p>Santa Barbara as a region first began to rise to fame in the early 2000’s as the area began winning top spots in the Cup of Excellence. The region is best showcased by our partners, the Paz Family at San Vicente, who are based in the town of Peña Blanca right in the center of the Santa Barbara region, just a couple hours drive south of San Pedro Sula. San Vicente is a family run business that started in the early 80’s. They are the main exporter of specialty coffee in Santa Barbara.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Along with milling and exporting coffee they partner with coffee producers in the area offering support in variety selection, agronomy, processing, and connecting producers to buyers. When driving through the region, you are always a stone’s throw away from award winning coffee producers. As buyers continue to flock to Santa Barbara there is increasingly more demand for the coffee as buyers wait in line to buy coffee from these award-winning coffee farms. Producers in the area continue to plant more coffee throughout the region to keep up with the demand as specialty coffee in the region grows.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout Santa Barbara, there is a subtle crispness in the air. Although the days can get warm, the cool air and occasional mist rising off Lake Yojoa cools the evenings, allowing the fruit to slowly ripen. This cool microclimate sees harvest about 2 months later than neighboring regions, later in the year than anywhere else in Central America. Since the rise in popularity has taken off, higher prices per pound have arrived throughout the region, and as a response more and more members of the community are staying in Santa Barbara, or even returning to the area to produce some of the most special coffee in the world. This year we are offering coffee from two producers in Santa Barbara.</p><p><br></p><h2>WHEN DRIVING THROUGH THE REGION, YOU ARE ALWAYS A STONE’S THROW AWAY FROM AWARD WINNING COFFEE PRODUCERS.</h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261376&c=5223487&h=rKRFsZTUF3CDmNVGiNSMNQEY4c-iqtAaex76krBCGDXXVPQk\" alt=\"Coffee producers in Santa Barbara\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p><a href=\"https://madcapcoffee.com/shop/coffee/juan-angel/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Juan Angel</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>On my first trip to Santa Barbara, we took a chance and knocked on the door of Juan Angel Izaguirre. To be fair, it was a calculated chance. His farm is surrounded by some of the most popular and award-winning growers in Santa Barbara, his trees looked healthy and beautiful, and the elevation of his farm at 1650 MASL is ideal for producing sweet, bright coffees. We asked for a sample. He went out back and scooped up a couple hundred grams of coffee that just dried in his back yard. That day we roasted it, and then cupped it the following morning. The coffee blew us away, and we’ve been buying it ever since.

Although we’re not licensed to sell alcohol, we found inspiration by Negroni Week and curated three unique variations using our coffee and tea.</p><p>One of the things that a classic cocktail, such as a negroni, achieves is the creation of a drink that pairs ingredients well, allowing each to have its say while being part of a larger experience. We don’t often see coffee being conceived of in this way. Rather, the prevailing view seems to be in favor of championing a “pure” coffee experience. It makes sense, as consistently making a coffee taste delicious can be hard enough.</p><p><br></p><p>What we stand to gain by championing coffee as an ingredient outweighs the risks and effort it takes to incorporate it into a delicious drink. This is one of the ideas animating our Featured Friday menu, as well as our Seasonal Drink menu — to recast coffee in a different light, to celebrate a coffee’s unique flavors by designing a whole drink around them. Suggestive, while also being delicious. Negroni Week serves as a perfect platform for us to showcase those ideas, have some fun, raise money for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wellhousegr.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">charity</a>, and serve some very tasty drinks.</p><p><br></p><p>For the uninitiated, a negroni consists of equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and Campari. The ingredients are stirred with ice, strained into a glass, and typically garnished with an orange peel. The drink is bittersweet and very complex, it has a heavy mouthfeel and a range of light and heavy flavors — citrus, roots, and botanicals are all on display. Because of it’s makeup, the negroni lends itself very well to variations, which makes it a great ideological starting point for a coffee-based negroni riff.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bogota Sunrise started with the idea that we could use strong, brewed coffee as a base for a drink that people could make at home without an espresso machine. The coffee from Luis Reinoso, with its clean citrus character, made for a great starting point. We settled on the aeropress as an effective brew method, and created a super-strong coffee using about the 4x the regular coffee dose. A very fine grind and lots of pressure in the aeropress allowed us to extract sweetness and acidity from the coffee. From there we looked for ingredients to play off the Luis’ coffee, and to interact with it in a negroni-like way. Grapefruit juice made a lot of sense, bringing bitterness and tartness, while tonic syrup would bring a big herbal, quinic bitterness and sweetness. From there, as it often does, the process shifted to recipe variations, finding the proportions of ingredients that worked the best together. Using 10 parts of Luis’ coffee ensured that coffee would be the major vehicle in this drink, the crux of it’s flavor and soul. This is a drink that I’m pretty proud of — capturing the best of Luis coffee alongside elements of the negroni, while being just plain tasty.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261378&c=5223487&h=V_bEmeF1bV_I-VelvimNIpdOHvfVPoeMK4wI-amaefc2_S4S\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p><br></p><p>The Negroni Bianco was the inspiration for the second drink, called Negro Bianco. We stole the name for this drink as we wanted to play off it’s clean citrus flavor and it’s nice drying finish. In building this beverage, we used the Huang Meigui white tea from Song tea. This tea is a smooth base to the drink, with its clean, juicy, body and its floral, honey, sweetness. To highlight the natural bitterness of the negroni we over-steeped the tea to recreate that enjoyable dry finish. Next, we added warming spices to help capture herbal sweetness and to add some complexity to the drink. Finally, we topped it off with some fresh squeezed grapefruit juice to open up the drink and add a final bitter fresh pucker to the drink. The result is a chilled and refreshing beverage that captures the cleanliness of the original, Negroni Bianco, yet stands alone as a unique spin on a classic cocktail using fresh new ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261379&c=5223487&h=Cm1tdoV5WwtZ1rmnnIlLCuxcpUp8mXHznpjd3jUCpgE1vx9A\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\"></p><p>The final drink was inspired by the predominate syrupy, cherry flavors of the original negroni. We call our drink, Té and Caffé Amaro. Now as you might know, coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit. To preserve the beans they must be removed from the skin of this fruit. The discarded peels of these fruits can be dried, resembling dehydrated fruit skin, and this is often called cascara. Because the cascara that we get from Santa Lucia in Costa Rica is dehydrated, it’s crunchy, like dried tea. When brewed as tea, it tastes of honey and cherry fruit. We then take the brewed cascara and reduce it down with lemon and orange peel. The result is a syrupy sweet cherry reduction with clean citrus notes, that pairs perfectly with our Third Coast espresso which has notes of black cherry and orange. Next, we chill the espresso which brings out a bit more of the positive bitter in the espresso. Then, we mix one part cascara reduction to two parts chilled espresso. The drink tastes like fruit loops and is perfectly balanced with a citrus pop and a pleasant syrupy body.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261380&c=5223487&h=E_9R3uVYyW-rRNExA9cL_Wx4tulsuS_gOjuF-_1jZrP4ktVg\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\" height=\"435\" class=\"\"></p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"Negroni Week drinks","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"June 6th marks the return of Negroni Week","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"4","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"Negroni Week drinks","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"261381","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"261381","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"5/27/2017 4:20:00 pm"}},{"addition_to_head":"","page_title":"Rivera: A Comfort Coffee","page_header":"Rivera: A Comfort Coffee","meta_description":"Rivera coffee consists of mainly Caturra and Bourbon varieties with a little bit of Typica.","meta_keywords":"","customrecorddata":"17","name":"Rivera: A Comfort Coffee","urlPath":"blog/rivera-a-comfort-coffee","url":"rivera-a-comfort-coffee","template":"default","type":1,"pageTypeName":"ext-blog-post","customrecordscriptid":"CUSTOMRECORD_SC_BLOG_PAGE_TYPE_POST","cmscreatable":true,"fields":{"custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_author":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_excerpt":"Rivera coffee consists of mainly Caturra and Bourbon varieties with a little bit of Typica.s","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_content":"<p>I first met Maria-Gracia and Jose Rivera in the Summer of 2016.

The coffee grows in a wet climate, wrapping around steep slopes filled with ample shade from native trees. Once harvested the coffee is pulped and fermented underwater, on-site before being dried on a covered patio for about two weeks. Agriculturally, the Riveras blend methods they’ve learned from traveling across the world and pair them with traditional Incan practices, placing a large value on harmony with the land. In the cup, Rivera is a comfort coffee: grounding, balanced, and reminiscent of standing on the earth with bare feet.

This was the inaugural year for the CoE competition in Peru, where hundreds of producers across the country submitted their finest lots. After 5 rounds of vigorous evaluation, the top scoring coffees were recognized as winners. The winning coffee was then auctioned off, and we were able to secure Efrain’s coffee with the highest bid, paying $51.40/lb, marking the most expensive coffee we’ve purchased to date at Madcap. We only have 65 pounds of this limited, award-winning coffee that we are excited to share with you. It will be available in our 3 Grand Rapids locations and our Detroit pop-up for $15 a cup. We also have 50 gram tins available to brew at home, or give as the perfect stocking stuffer for your coffee loving loved one.</p><p><br></p><p>We met Efrain and began working with him last season. It’s no surprise that we fell in love with his coffee after visiting his farm and seeing how he works. He’s become a leader in his village, and has taken many other producers under his wing, sharing his tips of what it takes to grow and process excellent coffee. He lives on his farm which is situated at desirable elevations that extend over 2,000 meters above sea level. The farm, which he started in 2007, is filled with nearly all Yellow Caturra variety that is carefully harvested, processed, and dried right outside his home.</p><p><br></p><p>We immediately noticed, this is a serious man, who is serious about his coffee. In an area where most coffee has been traditionally bulked and blended together, it has taken leaders like Efrain to lead the way, focusing on quality and the potential that lies ahead. The winning price of this lot of coffee achieves a price more than 25 times what the farm was receiving just a couple of years ago. The village of El Corazón, and even the surrounding region of Chirinos, has been in celebration following the competition, as it hasn’t just been a win for Efrain, but a win for the whole community and a glimpse of a bright future in coffee for the whole region.</p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"261388","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"261388","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"10/5/2017 4:41:00 pm"}},{"addition_to_head":"","page_title":"MUTHONJO, WILD AND WISE","page_header":"MUTHONJO, WILD AND WISE","meta_description":"The finest coffees from Kenya boast an intense combination of bright acidity, thick juicy sweetness, and deep lingering complexity.

In harmony, the fishermen sing a rich song of courage. With spears in hand, they fish Sambaza, the small local delicacy of the region. The sun is just rising, casting its glow across the Western edge of the country as it beams off the glossy body of water. The air is gentle and the energy is refreshing. As a visitor, it feels like magic as I sip on my morning coffee and look out over the lake. It feels other-worldly, but for folks of Rutsiro in Western Rwanda, this is just another day as the abundance of colorful native birds soar through the clear skies.</p><p><br></p><p>My first visit to Rutsiro region had been in 2006, twelve years prior to my most recent visit in May of 2018, and 12 years after the infamous genocide of ‘94. The country looked and felt quite different in 2006 than it does today. The beauty of the diverse expressive landscape and the strength of the thoughtful, resilient people remains. However, in 2006, the country was still quite tender and in rebuilding mode after the genocide took nearly a tenth of the population. At the time, leaders across the country had charted out where they wanted to be and how they wanted to get there to foster healing and generate a sustainable economy. There was deep hope and a sense of what needed to be done. One of the key components of Rwanda’s vision to sustainably rejuvenate the economy was through specialty coffee production (before my first visit, I was unaware that Rwanda even grew coffee).</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261499&c=5223487&h=ODAEicnNjXKIsb3IT3PLeN2kGktG3stMuLA8AZTyn4fOhwi3\" alt=\"Ejo Heza coffee drying stations\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p>Prior to the mid-2000s, specialty coffee was not being exported from Rwanda. Coffee existed, but it fell out of focus in the late 90s or early 2000s. The mountainous land, rich soil, and high elevations are all prime for coffee growing. So, with some support and studying coffee production in neighboring countries, Rwanda built washing stations throughout the country. They started training individual farmers and began producing coffee that has made its way onto coffee menus all across the world. Today, coffee is the number one export in Rwanda, a country just a tenth the size of the state of Michigan and it is continually recognized as a prominent producer of speciality coffee even as they continue to develop and mature their processes.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261501&c=5223487&h=y6oQUomyfITh03UQU6zaingzqZevaZ2_m7njZ9K2nGAMyeLO\" height=\"435\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\" class=\"\">On my most recent visit in 2018, I had the chance to visit the Ejo Heza coffee project. For me, Ejo Heza is an expression of what makes Rwanda, Rwanda. It offers creativity, elegance, and expression as it engages with depth and challenges. Ejo Heza translates from Kinyarwanda to “A Beautiful Tomorrow”. It’s an all-women’s coffee group that began in 2010 in partnership with KOPAKAMA Cooperative. Historically in Rwanda, women were responsible for tending the fields and working with the crops, thus making an all-female team growing coffee a natural fit. In addition, the group was developed to bring the community together. Following the genocide, 70% of the population were women, leaving many widowed. Though the Rustiro community has a mix of backgrounds, today ethnic designation has been outlawed and Rwandans are encouraged to identify as Rwandan, discarding ethnic labels. Ejo Heza goes a step further, with the women coming together to work as team members.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261502&c=5223487&h=aM2QNZBX1vRPHuUtH-gtbhgaoLrS_v9eVbokuopD0nagOp_Y\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\" class=\"\"></p><p>During my time visiting the project, I got to meet a few dozen of the farmers. In total, Ejo Heza has 382 members, more than doubling its membership from its inception in 2010. The members each have individual plots next to their homes, partnering together on additional community plots. We visited a community plot where they practice and test out sustainable agricultural techniques. Currently, they are studying different traditional ground covers for the coffee, and they were able to share with me their findings on the most suitable native canopy trees that they grow to offer shade for the coffee. The members of Ejo Heza meet regularly, receiving training in sustainable agricultural practices (from cherry selection to pruning techniques to suggested soil nutrients), with each member delivering their coffee to the centrally-located washing station.</p><p><br></p><p>After visiting the community plot, I spent time with the team at KOPAKAMA where the coffee is processed and washed. They have an impressive set-up paired with stunning views, which is actually quite common in the country known as the “Land of a Thousand Hills.” The processing follows the common traditional washed style: cherries are received, then floated, pulped, fermented, stomped, graded &amp; washed, soaked, pre-dried, dried, then stored—all before being sorted for export. Everything was well-organized and specific. Initially, I had been invited on the visit to offer some suggestions and feedback to help improve the quality and, while I always have a couple of ideas, I was left mostly silent and impressed by the process with little to add.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/core/media/media.nl?id=261500&c=5223487&h=YVFwz5PdZcogwgMYMpT_8mWYN3UApaJiVYay7i4LotgGlha-\" height=\"435\" style=\"border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(76, 157, 255); display: inline; user-select: none; white-space: pre-wrap; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"774\" class=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the day I spent some time with the members of Ejo Heza and received a glimpse of what it takes to make an organization like this sing brightly. We shared lunch together, which is an everyday staple at the washing station, and then we visited a few more coffee plots winding up, down, and around a few of the thousand lush, fertile and vibrant hills.</p><p><br></p><p>The day ended, similar to how it began: next to Lake Kivu. This time, I was enjoying a Mützig Lager, rather than a coffee, and enjoyed fried Sambaza, that was likely caught that morning. As I enjoyed a beer with my new Rwandan friends, we spent the evening together sharing stories, having a few laughs and talking about much more than simply coffee. The sun set, as beautiful, if not more so, than the way it rose earlier that day.

Nestled in the middle of the coffee region lies Honduras, an origin known for its wide array of coffees produced each year. Honduras continues to develop practices and&nbsp;overcome setbacks with the goal to improve and innovate the coffee industry as a whole.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Located just north of the equator, the region is optimal for coffee farms. The fertile soil, micro-climates, and topography provide the unique environment to grow exceptional coffee. Honduras, the leading coffee exporting country of Central America, produces coffees of both commercial grade and specialty grade. Coffee producers have begun focusing on farming practices to improve harvest quality, in pursuit of higher returns. Many of these coffee farmers live within a small region of the country: </span><a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/blog/the-coffee-of-santa-barbara\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"><u>Santa Barbara</u></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">.</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=281791&c=5223487&h=1qv8VcxpRPM2kxqYzLoVwYe5auQ5a57KVyhgCdKlFGGC8S0c\" height=\"3024\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"4032\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">In the late summer of 2021, Santa Barbara was hit by multiple hurricanes, severely impacting the harvest of coffee producers throughout the country. Several of the producers we work with lost around 50% of their harvests. The development of fruit-bearing coffee trees can take up to 4-5 years, meaning farmers will be working towards full recovery over the next several years.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">When natural disasters, like the hurricanes in 2021, leave producers with a fraction of their harvest, it directly impacts their anticipated income.

Over the years, we’ve witnessed coffee farmers adapt to circumstances inflicted via the market, as well as the climate. With the growth of the specialty coffee market, farmers have implemented new agricultural practices for managing soil, crop placement, and selective harvesting — to name a few. Each new act shares the goal of increasing the quality of their harvest.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=282600&c=5223487&h=ldKJAh3vR7rYGUfGsgsYQHeVfwBr6QQHu1o_k-_Xx9HmpRex\" alt=\"Coffee farming at origin\" height=\"780\" style=\"display: inline; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;\" width=\"3000\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>The second step is processing</h3><p>Within days of being harvested, coffee cherries are processed in preparation to be transported thousands of miles around the world. While there are a number of different processing practices, each works towards reducing the moisture content of the coffee seed to around 11% and <a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/cascara-coffee-cherry\" target=\"_blank\"><u>removing the cherry skin</u></a> and mucilage surrounding the seed. Often, as we’ve learned, the processing practices have been passed down generationally from farmer to farmer.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=282601&c=5223487&h=ATzUia1KTIN44BDn5pFvKANCq-UU3NlN8qdfP8jTucKDDJ8M&495156\" alt=\"Processing coffee at a mill\" height=\"1333\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2000\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The third step is exporting</h3><p>While some coffee farms have the amenities for processing coffee, many rely on exporters for assistance. Exporting companies often have the facilities for milling, bagging, and storing the coffee in warehouses in preparation for shipment. They will also perform cuppings (process of evaluating the quality) in order to best find specific buyers for each coffee. We are grateful to consistently work with exporting teams who present us with excellent coffees and introduce new partnerships, while also coordinating shipping logistics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=282602&c=5223487&h=edA1S6bySDLl8I8me40L5LSVDy67gpVW9GQ2GWtM9ehjblJ8\" alt=\"Madcap Coffee team with importers\" height=\"1500\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2000\"></p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><p><br></p><h3>The fourth step is importing</h3><p>Shipping and receiving is an imperative part of the seed-to-cup process, as the majority of coffee consumption occurs outside of the origin of which the coffee was grown. On the receiving side is a team of importers. This group of professionals work with exporters to source coffees and connect roasting companies with producers. Importers assist with shipping logistics and maintain an import license, allowing them to import goods produced in a foreign country. Like exporters, importers also perform cuppings, allowing them the insight to determine ideal price points and find a market option for each coffee.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=282603&c=5223487&h=nDCn1Tevp5F-i1-wJ9W8xotYeq9jKlNrwvgr7ABI-3aNGkiu\" alt=\"Cupping coffee at origin\" height=\"2037\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2000\"></p><p><br></p><h3>The penultimate step is roasting</h3><p>At <a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/blog/sustainability-at-madcap-coffee\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Madcap’s HQ</u></a>, we store green (unroasted) coffee in our warehouse. This back stock allows us to roast specifically what we need, ensuring only fresh batches are released for retail. The art of roasting highlights the complexity and terroir of where a coffee was grown. Each coffee has a unique roast profile, which is developed through trial batches and a number of cuppings. Once a coffee is roasted for production, our crew labels and packs each bag in preparation for shipment. Meanwhile, our marketing and sales team is working diligently to <a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\"><u>share the stories</u></a> of the beautiful coffees on our menu.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=282604&c=5223487&h=Wk7BUe9PXX3vL-TdU6la-3ZhyONxk7PMAhkq3LI3YZeZIkNx\" alt=\"Madcap Coffee roastery and production\" height=\"1302\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2022\"></p><p><br></p><h3>The final step is the one you’re probably most familiar with: brewing</h3><p>The art of brewing coffee has been expressed in both scientific and elementary fashions.

It has a dual boiler allowing you to pull shots of espresso and steam milk at the same time and PID temperature control to better adjust both espresso and milk temperature. This machine is also great if you want to make back-to-back drinks.

However, this classification falls short of portraying the entirety of the coffee growing community and truly honoring the beautiful work happening throughout the country.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Colombia’s history with coffee production dates back several centuries to the colonial era. The agricultural environment and climate encouraged large plantations—haciendas—to operate for mass coffee production. Consequently, local farmers and workers were mistreated, underpaid, and forced into an unsustainable lifestyle. Shortly after the Great Depression, the Colombian government purchased these plots of land and divided them out to smallholder farmers. The farmers were encouraged to produce coffee alongside other crops to reestablish the economy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=285222&c=5223487&h=50UnzuTFkI9xE2Ef1SkCHWHaHEcCJoq3kQio8addHNR8PZwC\" alt=\"Buildings and mountains in Colombia\" height=\"1512\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2016\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">By the mid-20th century, marketing campaigns and international demand fuelled the region to become world renowned. The Juan Valdez campaign used the phrase “100% Colombian coffee,” seeking to distinguish Colombian-grown coffee from the rest of the market. This distinction encouraged Colombian coffee prices to increase, ultimately incentivising farmers to pursue coffee agriculture. While the marketing campaigns encouraged growth for commercial-grade coffee, systems began to form to protect the efforts of smaller producers growing specialty-grade coffee. Organizations like the </span><a href=\"https://www.cafeimports.com/north-america/colombia\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"><u>Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia</u></a><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"> (also known as the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation) support small farmers through research and technological development, as well as partnering with producers to work towards sustainable profits each year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=285223&c=5223487&h=IeC1c29R7Kdhe3V3Dr5kiRs57u5NOl_lTpPHZ7DzXo-M7Fvo\" alt=\"A tour of Colombian coffee farm\" height=\"1512\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2016\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Today, Colombia grows a number of different coffee varieties, the majority of which are the arabica species. The northwest region of Colombia has a unique topography, due to the Andes mountain range cascading through. This brings forward elevation changes and micro-climates that provide exceptional coffee growing conditions. Situated in the heart of the mountain range, a few hours drive from Bogotá, is the region of Tolima. This small pocket of Colombia is home to some of the finest coffee in the country, and it is also home to the Reinoso family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3>Madcap Coffee's Partnership with the Reinosos</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/luis-reinoso-colombia\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"><u>Luis and Yenni Reinoso</u></a><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"> are a husband and wife duo who own and operate a coffee farm near Herrara, Tolima. On their farm, they grow several varieties of coffee, including Caturra, Bourbon, and Geisha. Living on the premises, Luis is able to oversee the processing of the coffee cherries and make any necessary adjustments needed from weather conditions. The drying stage is under Yenni’s supervision. The process begins on the Reinoso’s roof, where Yenni evenly distributes the coffee to dry on tile patios before the coffee is transferred to raised beds a few feet away.</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=285224&c=5223487&h=clYEu0NG56KfzhZHJncc2cWQIPpzIkgq0SnYVhCk1m_qbn_P\" alt=\"Yenni and Luis Reinoso and their fmaily\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">The Reinoso family represents a movement of smaller coffee producers pushing the limits of coffee production and harvesting excellent crops. Smallholder producers combat rising average temperatures, which brings natural challenges to crop development and yield quality. Luis and Yenni seek to elevate each harvest through frequent selective hand picking, closely monitoring the development of each coffee tree. This intentionality allows them to harvest each cherry at peak ripeness, yielding brighter acidity and clean sweetness.

The latter one makes it basically impossible to get a consistent grind size throughout. There are two types of burr grinders: flat and conical. The precision offered by flat burr grinders make them common in cafes. Conical burr grinders while not as precise as the flat option do a great job at a more affordable price.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=286536&c=5223487&h=VfMpWoWPdYDuP43c9bHT_eCdiuymGAmjwyrrIfQy82pzQvyw\" alt=\"Josiah with a Breville and Baratza grinder\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p><br></p><p>While there are a lot of great conical burr grinders for at-home use, some of our favorites are the Breville Precision Grinder and the <a href=\"https://baratza.com/grinder/sette-30/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Baratza Sette 30</u></a>. Both of these grinders have 30 steps that allow for control over the fineness of your grind.</p><p><br></p><p>Whichever grinder you choose, make sure you’re cleaning it out when you switch coffee and grind the coffee fresh right before you brew.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/core/media/media.nl?id=286535&c=5223487&h=x268KyHzqceAoyiPUPPu1IWAGCLnaxjmsM-1bLeNj5kJ_OmB\" height=\"1080\" style=\"border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(76, 157, 255); display: inline; user-select: none; white-space: pre-wrap; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><p>For scales, you should be using them when you’re measuring out coffee for each dose and the weight of espresso out.

That said, a standard kitchen scale typically does the trick, too!</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, but possibly most importantly, you want to make sure you’re using good water. If you don’t drink the water from your sink, you definitely don’t want to use it to make coffee (espresso or drip). If you have a good home filter, the often does the trick, but if you really want to level up your espresso, we suggest <a href=\"https://www.madcapcoffee.com/third-wave-water\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Third Wave Water</u></a>.

Then, you’ll put your portafilter under the grinder and grind the coffee beans. With Eureka, you’ll want a 1:1.8 or 1:2 ratio. Once the coffee is in the portafilter, place it on the scale. It should weigh 15 grams.</p><p><br></p><p>Settle the coffee grounds by tapping the portafilter on the counter so that the bed is flat and even. After, get your tamp and while keeping it level with the coffee grounds, hold your arm at a 90 degree angle and push down into the grounds, keeping the tamper straight the whole time.

This will keep you from overheating the ground coffee before you start pulling your shot. You’ll want to put a vessel and scale under the portafilter. Before the espresso starts coming out, tare the scale to ensure that you get an accurate measurement and ratio. On average, the shot should take 25-32 seconds, which will result in a shot with a thick, full-bodied texture.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Once you’ve pulled your shot, remember to clean up your station.

When choosing milk, the higher the fat content, the sweeter it will be. You can also use a dairy milk alternative, like oat milk or soy milk (just know they’re a bit harder to do latte art with).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Add milk to the pitcher. The amount will vary depending on what type of drink you’re making.</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=289871&c=5223487&h=jM2n5Acj4883SLfqedFsYZ6Jq3UXV4UWao6bgry6fp3vIDS6\" alt=\"Purging the steam wand\" height=\"1296\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2304\"></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Before you start steaming your milk, make sure to purge the steam wand. When you do this, you’ll want to wrap a towel around the wand to protect your hand from the heat and any water that might spray out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Once you purge the wand, you’ll insert it into the pitcher along the spout. This will keep the pitcher stable while you’re steaming. The wand should be in the pitcher at a 45 degree angle. You’ll want the tip of the wand just submerged into the milk. As the milk aerates, you’ll pull the wand up a bit (aiming for a wet paint texture for a latte or a marshmallow fluff texture for a cappuccino). Angle it slightly to the left or the right to create a vortex that will integrate the microfoam.</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=289872&c=5223487&h=ckjU5syTrn1Foy_zkHJnknHWFPVYeUexxEPmdJ3JHYx9JZQB\" alt=\"Steaming milk in the milk pitcher\" height=\"2160\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3840\"></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">You’re aiming for a temperature that matches your body temperature. To do this, you’ll stop steaming around when the pitcher is too hot to touch with your free hand. For a cappuccino, you’ll turn off the steam wand as soon as the pitcher is too hot to touch.

For a long time, coffee was seen as merely a commodity and supply needed to meet the high demand. However, there were small coffee producers doing incredibly intentional practices, cultivating exceptional coffees that deserved recognition and compensation. With these producers in mind, the Cup of Excellence (COE) was founded in 1999.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=603979&c=5223487&h=Ww2kx8yj2kQjmKzX97ECbqPlpDjzyYGhzHTk1q-k71M0wqjc\" alt=\"Coffee drying in El Salvador\" height=\"2240\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3360\" class=\"\"></p><p>The COE originated in Brazil with the intention of highlighting specialty coffee producers who were often overlooked for the farms producing higher volumes of coffee. This made it challenging for the smaller producers to find a proper market to sell their coffees at a respectable price point. The COE created an auction format where producers submit their coffee to be professionally cupped and scored, and then placed in an auction. This system allows producers to gain recognition for their hard work and to receive premiums for their product. The success of this auction encouraged the platform to spread into over a dozen coffee growing countries.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Producers can submit coffee scoring 86+ points (for reference, specialty coffee is considered 80+ points out of 100). Once submitted, a team of professionals cup the coffees without knowing any information about them. The top 30 coffees are submitted to be entered into the Cup of Excellence for their specific country. From here, the coffee is cupped 6 different times by a National Jury and an International Jury.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=602577&c=5223487&h=Y5rMN1KUj4MrLc3ESvDKb79lDiqylIaR979IINaoV0a2yWFn&2098383\" alt=\"Madcap team cupping coffee in El Salvador\" height=\"2240\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3360\" class=\"\"></p><p>Madcap has been participating in the Cup of Excellence since we began.

Over the years, the Rodriguez family has planted many seedlings of these trees and heavily invested in research into it. This varietal has been a favorite of ours for over a decade and one we were eager to bid on in the auction. All bidding begins at $6.50/lb, with each bid increasing in $0.10 increments.

Just shy of a decade later, Juan’s son Irvin inherited a plot of land from his father. With the median age of coffee producers rising, this partnership brings hope for the future generations. Irvin’s coffee is the pacas variety, grown at 1,850 MASL. In the cup, look for vibrant acidity, red fruit sweetness, and clarity.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=285224&c=5223487&h=clYEu0NG56KfzhZHJncc2cWQIPpzIkgq0SnYVhCk1m_qbn_P&668848\" alt=\"The Reinoso family\" height=\"1080\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1920\"></p><h3>Luis Reinoso + Yenni Reinoso</h3><p>We approach each producer partnership with the mindset of creating a sustainable relationship that will withstand time. Since 2010, we have been working with the husband and wife duo Luis and Yenni Reinoso from Tolima, Colombia. While they both work together to manage their estates, we buy multiple varieties of coffee from them each year, which is why they each have their own respective labels. Luis’ coffee is primarily Caturra, Bourbon, and Colombia varieties grown at lower elevations. The coffee donning Yenni’s name is grown at higher elevations on their property, and is made of our favorite varieties on their farm each year. With Luis managing the fieldwork and Yenni overseeing the drying, the Reinosos are able to harvest and process their coffee all onsite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=664328&c=5223487&h=LS9MZ21eaVivA8rEYsniegB_IO6Fmp8q4RIOxCmzsM1FdFZ_\" alt=\"Gitwe coffee farm\" height=\"2000\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3000\"></p><h3>Gitwe</h3><p>Each coffee on our menu necessitates dozens of different professionals along the value chain. One of the exporting companies we partner with is Long Miles Coffee Project, based out of East Africa. They are doing incredible work in the growing regions in Burundi, Kenya, and Uganda, such as building the Heza Washing Station in Kayanza, Burundi. This washing station is located near seven different hills, each with unique terroir. Gitwe is one of those hills. This Bourbon variety exemplifies tropical sweetness, round body, and clean acidity. The experience reminds us of the relationships developed and the exceptional coffee being grown throughout East Africa.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=664329&c=5223487&h=ylfgvJsup-Yk-tFvcka_IJ3zEeHXpMV3YScjTLf6c6kaIPUL&3263758\" height=\"2465\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3024\"></p><h3>Samuel Degelo&nbsp;</h3><p>The award-winning coffee grown by Samuel Degelo has been exceptional each year we’ve contracted it. Guji, Ethiopia, is one of the most popular coffee growing regions in the world. It is one of the few places where coffee trees grow naturally throughout the land. Samuel’s coffee is a rare experience of tasting an individual producer’s lot, as it is common for communities to pool their harvests together. In the cup, look for tropical notes of coconut, as well as juicy peach-like sweetness.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=664330&c=5223487&h=OxPcvjlYVTRBH1J8B5Dra2Yy7N1So5V2-3ySCg9e7LU4RWVN&2857286\" height=\"2240\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3360\"></p><h3>Elefante</h3><p>This year was a milestone for the Rodriguez family in El Salvador. Gloria and Luis have been longtime partners and friends of Madcap, having grown the first coffee Madcap ever purchased. Over the years, Luis discovered a mysterious variety growing on their farm. The cherry is so large and contains nearly ten times more juice than a typical coffee cherry, so this new variety was dubbed Elefante. This unique coffee is grown throughout their farm, requiring a high level of maintenance and intentionality for harvesting. Each year we pay nearly four times the market price of coffee to contract as much Elefante as possible. This premium is for the labor involved in harvesting, the high quality of the coffee, and the commitment to excellence the Rodriguez’ display with every crop.</p><p><br></p><h3><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=664431&c=5223487&h=uw8cgkTpPeuL9W5-3TDDbwEEBgIbsh9n8Vv6JSSgl9dqPZOC&1994661\" height=\"2240\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"3360\"></h3><h3>Elefante Nueva Granada Cup of Excellence</h3><p>To join this year’s Elefante, Roberto Rodriguez submitted a separation of Elefante to the Cup of Excellence for El Salvador. This competition showcases the best of the best from each origin. The family is known to find success at the COE, having ranked in the top 20 a number of times. This year, Roberto’s separation of Elefante ranked #6, holding the top spot above all other washed coffees in the country. This separation is extremely floral, delicate, and full of red fruit.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=664432&c=5223487&h=4MgpqAU8jSud1sinoF11pRERMFniPIXgZpA9R1Yi6jVJd6vA&8535103\" height=\"1519\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"2700\"></p><h3>Finca de Dios</h3><p>Finca de Dios is a coffee that speaks for itself. The Prentice family owns and operates an innovative farm in the Fraijanes region of Guatemala. Ellen and Stuart, a trained botanist and engineer respectively, use their expertise to harvest exceptional coffee and design equipment needed to process on site. Their daughter, Ashley, brings her expertise of the coffee industry and agricultural climate to round out this multi-generational family effort. This coffee has a silky texture, agave sweetness, with a bit of orange acidity.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=261493&c=5223487&h=4lbo6386fjr3I-IulvBS_L7mysnW2nltKELWj032QErsRz6D&124138\" height=\"456\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"684\"></p><h3>Kanda AA, AB, and PB separations</h3><p>Finishing off this year’s Best of 2023 set are three separations from Amos Ndatakiura’s farm, in Kiringyaga, Kenya. Amos primarily grows SL-28, a coffee variety developed in Kenya that has become synonymous with Kenyan coffee. Amos’ estate sits on two hectares of land next to Mount Kenya. Onsite, Amos has the infrastructure to pulp, ferment, wash, and dry his coffee in preparation for shipment. This level of care and involvement allows the quality of his coffee to be preserved and maintained to his liking, which ultimately shows in the cup.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Each separation carries a different title, corresponding to the physical size of the coffee bean. Coffee beans vary in size and shape, depending on a number of different factors. Oftentimes, harvests are combined without any sorting, resulting in a less dynamic cup. Amos’ coffee was sorted using a series of screens, separating like-sized coffee beans together. The AA represents the larger screen size, AB is the medium sized screen, and PB (also referred to as “peaberry”) is the smallest, due to its petite and round shape.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is a unique opportunity to experience coffee from a single producer in Kenya. Similar to Ethiopia, coffee growing communities in Kenya often pool their harvests together to obtain higher yields. With Amos’s coffee, you get to experience the individuality of three separations, which shows in the clarity of each cup. When roasting, the uniform size allows for more control and specificity, as the density and shape of beans react differently throughout the roasting process.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This years’ Best Of 2023 set is a curation of memories and long lasting friendships. It is exciting to see each of these coffees compiled together in a set, side by side, to be enjoyed and shared.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/core/media/media.nl?id=279061&c=5223487&h=cvS7pXqhlKqFoOXFoAdm87yt5y7LUdZsrca6b-OEMh3t9JJi&596962\" height=\"940\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\" width=\"1670\"></p>","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_timg_img_alt":"Best of 2023 Coffee tasting set","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_subheading":"Our team's favorite coffee from the last 12 months.","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pinned_to":"1,3,5","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_category":"1","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_post_tags":"","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_hdr_image_alt":"Best of 2023 Coffee tasting set","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_header_image":"664027","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_thumbnail_img":"664026","custrecord_sc_blog_post_pt_pub_date":"11/30/2023 10:27:54 am"}}]},"_debug_requestTime":86};
